I'm a senior undergraduate at Wellesley College majoring in Computer Science and Architecture.

My research interests center around Large Language Models for natural language, code generation, and multimodal data, with a focus on interpretability and reasoning.

Currently, I'm working on neural network interpretability for Code Large Language Models under Prof. [Arjun Guha](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/home/arjunguha/main/home/) at NEU, and benchmarking Vision-Language models on patterns in human writing systems under Prof. [Carolyn Anderson](https://canders1.github.io) at Wellesley College.
