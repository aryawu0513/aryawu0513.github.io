I'm a senior undergraduate at Wellesley College majoring in Computer Science and Architecture Design.

My research interests lie in natural language processing and multimodal machine learning, with a focus on interpretability, representation, and reasoning.

Currently, I'm working on neural network interpretability for Code LLMs, and benchmarking VQA for vision-language models.
