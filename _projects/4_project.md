<p>The project focuses on designing and engineering systems to lower the entry barrier for beginners and support novices in learning hands-on creative maker skills, from building electronics to fabricating physical artifacts. The main goal of this project is to study how users can learn prototyping through self-reflection.</p>

<p>My main role in this project is to help prototype and design the hardware tools, as well as design the storyboard of the experiment that specifies reflective prompts and user interactive responses.</p>
