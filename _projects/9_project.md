WAVE is a web application, inspired by 25Live, where students can publicize the events they are hosting. Users can upload their own events, see who has RSVPâ€™d to their event, RSVP to posted events, and save events. This allows students to publicize unofficial (and official) events through an organized user interface. Currently many events are publicized through posters placed throughout dorms or on Sidechat. We would like to allow users to publish their posters online and reach a wider audience of students. 25Live is limited to school-sponsored events. WAVE would provide the same benefits without limiting by type of event. Instead, we would allow students to organize their events by tags so users could filter for events they are interested in.
